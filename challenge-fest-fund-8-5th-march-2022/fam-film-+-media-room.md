## Summary

**0:08 Daniel VanCast:** Animated Explainers for the World  [https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/400037](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/400037)

First-time proposer; short (2-minute) animated explainers in six different languages, especially Spanish and Portuguese, because we are in Latin America. We are Criteria Animation, [https://criteriaanimation.com](https://criteriaanimation.com) an animation company; not too big, but we have won a lot of awards. Our content could be the story of Cardano from the beginning; how Cardano works; etc. We haven’t decided the topics; it’s important to talk to other people to decide this.

**2:37   Petr, Challenge Team** Whole idea of this challenge is to bring better understanding to the average Joe, in an easy and understandable way.

**4:01  Luca**  In fund 7 we were funded for Lat Am School. If you're interested, maybe we could combine your proposal with us.&#x20;

**5:57  Victor Larde** One Small Town project. We proposed in fund 7 [https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/384476](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/384476)  and did not get funded, but it helped us to do a white paper for our project. And now we are looking to implement One Small Town in a specific town in Lebanon; and we would like to record the process. Young people 18 to 25 years old will create on Tik Tok, Instagram and YouTube, anything related to the blockchain initiative of the use of blockchain tools. The major challenge for us will be to buy materials. _\[Summariser’s note: this proposal wasn’t finalised and submitted for fund 8]_

**7:58  Petr, Challenge Team**  To share real stories is very important. We have a lot of YouTube videos that include technical details, but don't share the story of a person.

**9:46 Session Cruz** I’m really in the dApps and Integrations challenge; I'm building a music player and music platform [https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396558](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396558)  The music player is on the blockchain and allows listeners to pay-per-stream directly to the artists – so, automated royalty payments for all rights holders. So it allows a record label to easily enter Web 3 and offer various crypto products direct to consumer. Music streaming is the first utility, but then I want to be able t, offer the ability for record labels to mint NFTs,  social tokens, fractional royalties, etc. Write it all on one platform built on Cardano.

**11:29 Petr, Challenge Team**  There was an idea about a recording studio. [https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396842](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396842)  Maybe you can find some cooperation there

**12:20  Raz** On what Daniel was saying about the animation. The challenge with communicating complex stories in multiple languages – with animation, you can have an animation with no speech; maybe you creatives can find a way to create a video that overcomes the need for words.

**13:20  Daniel** That's a good idea, but the kind of information we try to send is not easy in only images.&#x20;

**14:23  Lucio** _\[Summariser’s note: this proposal wasn’t finalised and submitted for fund 8]_ **** A practical connection between video and the Cardano blockchain: take a short video or short web series with different episodes that tell the same story from different points of view. The user gets some clues inside of the video itself; and in this way, they can get some NF Ts that will unlock the next episode of the story. We’d like to also have clues in real spaces – so, for example, in the place when the video will be shot, there will be some QR code, something that people can use to get their NF T's for the next episode. In the future this could be used to promote tourism or stuff like that. So the idea was to basically create a basic MVP with this concept and try to see if it gets traction, and it will be liked by people.\
I'm not sure if it really fits in this challenge, because the results are this kind of technological level that may be a better in the dApps challenge.

**17:53  Raz** When you mentioned about QR codes in the physical space, it reminded me of geocaching. Maybe this proposal could be split; you have the technical portion of it in the dApps category and the content and creative side in this category.

**18:28  Lucio** If we present it as one proposal in this challenge, will it fit or is it a bit out of scope?

**18:58  Raz** With our challenge brief, were seeing it as a category to bring creatives together; and that’s creatives in all senses, which includes coding and development of an app, etc.

**19:57  Eric** I don’t have a proposal in this category, but I work with KUAF, a local radio station in the US that is under NPR, national programme radio. We are working on doing blockchain podcasts; not specifically for Cardano, although I'm deeply involved with Cardano. And there's also local TV stations here that want to do a similar thing to podcasts; visual podcasting, so to speak.

I live in the United States, but I actually am Swedish, and I have a background in radio and TV in Sweden since the 90s. My view is that I want to use as many media as possible to get as much information about blockchain and cryptocurrencies and whatever you can think of, because to me, it is all about education and countering misinformation and scams. If I can do it locally here, it might get picked up nationally.

**24:05 Petr, Challenge Team**  That's why this challenge is here. I am from Czech Republic, I work for Czech national television; and I've been trying for two years to talk with people here about Cardano and blockchain. It's extremely tough because people are misinformed and still don't take it seriously. So we want to change this.

**24:51  Eric** I'm being a little tricky with the radio station; I'm calling the podcast “Blockchain and the future of money”. Because I think we all can agree that America is run by money;  everybody's thinking about money daily, and how to make money; so I'm using that as a hook to interest people; but we talk about things like, what's the structure of blockchain, where did blockchain come from, in short segments so it's not overwhelming to people. I’m inspired by this community, and want to share ideas and material with everyone.

**26:20  Daniel**  The problem is always the same - getting information to people. If you think in the US it’s difficult, in Latin America it’s worse – talking about anything that is not Bitcoin is very difficult. It’s cool to use ideas like music and video to reach people. In the future I believe money will all be crypto; and the main problem is that the information is not getting to ordinary people.

**28:49  Eric** One approach that has worked for me is – I don't approach the blockchain and crypto market from a monetary standpoint; I talk about trust. I think the need for trust is universal, so people respond to it. I'm Swedish – and the gaming industry and music industry  in Sweden are huge, so when I talk to my Swedish friends about blockchain, I don’t say “You can make a lot of money”; I say “How do you know that your gaming or your music is trusted?” A good friend of mine said “the Internet brought people together. Blockchain is bringing trust to Internet.” And I could not agree with him more.

I am a Cardano fan, but I think it’s about all blockchains. Often people are surprised to learn that there is more than one! But I don’t care which blockchain someone prefers; to me we are all working for the same goal of trust on the network.

Blockchain is going to be the future. I mean, look at the Internet in the beginning of the 90s – hardly anybody believed in it. But today, it’s standard. I think the same will happen with blockchain.

**32:07  Petr, Challenge Team**  I believe you are right. What this challenge is looking for is real life use-cases, so that people can understand a project because it's somewhat real, not just technical details.

**32:46  Luca** A problem for me at first, was that I started by “preaching” Cardano. But if we are talking to average people, who don't know about crypto, maybe it’s best to start with the philosophy of crypto – get people interested in the  technology, in the philosophy, in trust, as Eric said.

**34:05  Raz** I think that's a very important point. Because if we think back to the context of how Bitcoin came about, in 2008 – global financial crisis, mistrust of our financial system, banks, governments; then fast forward to today, Cardano is here. When you speak to people, you have to bring it onto a level that everyone can understand. The world is not all unicorns and rainbows - and there's a technology now that's offering a solution. We're living in a political world. And we can't rely on what's on TV to be our source of knowledge. So how do you translate complex projects that are having a real use-case implementation today, this minute, and broadcast that story out there? Because the big media giants aren't necessarily picking up those stories. So who's gonna do that?

**35:46  Eric** Yeah, that's a very deep question. I try to not address or approach national media here in the United States – it might work differently in other countries, but generally they might not want to cover these issues. So I talk locally; then hopefully, if that gets traction, then it gets picked up by other local stations. Also, when you do something on your own, there are things that can help. [Odysee](https://odysee.com) for instance, is like YouTube but it's blockchain based; when you post something on there, you actually earn cryptocurrencies, and because it's not owned by anybody, it can't be taken down. There's always good and bad with these things – you might notice, for instance, that there are right-wing people, the Trump fans, on there – but that's okay, we have to take the good with the bad. I’d love to see a program like Odysee built on the Cardano network.

And Luca, I agree with you – I love Cardano, but I'm also very deeply involved in the cross platform stuff; we need to find bridges between, there needs to be a very simple way to go from Ethereum to Cardano to Bitcoin, to whatever it is, seamlessly.

**39:52  Michael** My proposal in this challenge is an iPod podcast, in a conversational format. I have an educational background and my partner has an advertising / web development background; and we're really interested in bridging the gap between the larger world and what's going on in Cardano. With the developers, there is naturally kind of an echo chamber thing that happens where they're talking about technical details and it's not necessarily really connected to the outside world. And that's normal, because it's just new, and it's all bootstrapping, and getting rolling. But we want to step into that space. So when I saw that there was an arts and media category, I felt really happy that we're gonna find a home there.

We're based in Alberta, Canada. And we're thinking about interviewing people completely outside blockchain. One example – there's a guy in Canada called [David Diamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David\_Diamond\_\(theatre\)), who does community awareness theatre – he goes into communities and does these improvised theatrical things where people from the audience represent stakeholders in different social situations. I saw a piece he did about Native people here in Alberta, dealing with logging companies and the police. \[_Summariser’s note: Diamond’s approach is inspired by Forum Theatre, as pioneered by_ [_Augusto Boal_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto\_Boal).] And it seems to me that Cardano is like that, where it's kind of like the elephant thing. We're all kind of running around, you know, here's the trunk, here's the ears, and what does the elephant look like? sort of thing, right? So that that could be like a really fascinating perspective on this whole thing, just as one example, right? Or to talk about a proposal, going through line by line and asking “what does this mean?” and discussing it.

**43:32  Raz** Thanks, Michael, for sharing and hi, as a fellow educator: I’ve worked in London, Paris, in Indonesia, in secondary schools and universities.

**43:48  Michael** One thing I'm really interested in is how collaboration can work in this context, because, you know, everybody's got their own idea; how we might collaborate is not clear to me in terms of a proposal process.

**44:19  Petr, challenge team** For me, it's very simple. We meet; we learn from each other; and for example, one proposal gets voted, but we all know that, for example, Daniel is working on animations, Eric is doing podcasts – we all have our roles, and we can connect and cooperate. That's why we are here.

**44:47   Michael**  I'm new here and I haven't been through this process at all. So are you saying, for example: let's say I meet you and we talk, and we're on the same page about certain things; and let's say you get funding and we don't get funding – and then we would maybe say, “Oh, Michael, you come over and join us”?  Is that what happens?

**45:15  Petr, challenge team** For me, for sure. For example, if I have a project where I need some specific jobs to be done; by meeting all of you here, I know what you can do, and I can then ask you to get involved.

**45:45  Michael** Is there a way for projects to report back to the community on their progress?

**45:58  Petr, challenge team** I just want to mention that in IdeaScale it is possible to connect 2 projects into one.

**46:27  Raz** Yes, if you’ve got your project, and then you discover another project team that’s doing something similar, then up to the 17th \[_proposal submission deadline_] anything on the platform can be edited so you could combine. But even after that, collaboration opportunities don’t end; you can update in the comment section.

**48:15  Marta** Also, if you find somebody that you want to collaborate with, you can withdraw your proposal and join another person's proposal. You just re-title your proposal “Withdraw”, and then join another proposal, so that is stronger because there's more people involved.

**48:54  Michael** On this theme, I want to make a little pitch here, because we're also proposing in Miscellaneous about a facilitated learning model \[_summariser’s note – this actually seems to have landed in Accelerate Decentralised Identity, as this proposal_ [_https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398274_](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398274) ]. So any of you that have an educational component, and if you have participants or audience members who are following you or involved in your project, we're thinking that it would be very helpful to hook up people who are committed to learning something, so they can check in with each other in groups of 3, and report in a semi-structured way; it’s a peer validation model, and it’s working towards the decentralisation of assessment, to take assessment out of the hands of the institutions and governments and into our own wallets.

So everybody here, if you want to participate with us, we would offer to facilitate your audience’s learning, through you.

**51:22  Daniel** I have a proposal in this challenge, called Theatre for Change [https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396566](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/396566)  I want to use interactive theatre to educate students about blockchain technology, because we believe that one of the effective ways we have to communicate is through theatre and art. So we’ll go into secondary schools in Ghana, and educate students on Cardano blockchain and its applications using interactive theatre; the students are also going to be performing to educate their fellow students. We’ll record the performances and upload it online and use it as a learning material in, for example education seminars about blockchain technology.

I’ve used this methodology effectively before, to address the issue of high rates of teenage pregnancy in a community in Ghana. We used interactive theatre as a way to educate, and as a result, teenage pregnancy was reduced dramatically, so it is very effective.

**53:52  Petr, challenge team** Thank you, Daniel for sharing. We are running out of time a bit. So on a last note, I would like to say that our challenge is also about cooperation with other challenges. We want to inform and educate; that's our main and common goal. So don't hesitate to reach out to other challenges and meet people from there; and let's learn what they are doing.

**54:37  Cole, challenge team** And please share all your proposals in Telegram chat so we can cross collaborate.

**54:52  Raz** And about education, we can continue the conversation on the Telegram channel, if you're not already there. Also Cole and I are from Sustainable ADA, and we'd love to learn about all the impactful projects in our community and hopefully, maybe help collaborate in some way to tell your story in your words.

**55:44  Petr, challenge team** We also have a Discord channel.

**55:52  Eric** One thing that I have noticed in several different groups is: everybody comes with brilliant proposals, but focused on their little corner of the world. Blockchain is worldwide, so don’t just think for your country. You might do a film or theatre thing in your language, but it could be posted in a way that the whole world would see it.

**57:16 Raz** Sometimes we thinking we're the only one with an idea; and then you realise someone else has something very similar. I think this is the experiment that we're all part of – the first step is sometimes the hardest, just to put your idea out there. And then if you're open, you find each other.

**57:48  Petr, challenge team** Sometimes it's not a bad thing to be local, because that's where the stories are, that's where you have some specific example of Cardano usage, or things you want to talk about. So I say, let's start local and build up towards global.

**58:19  Marta** I would also say that it depends on the project.. I've been talking to people building metaverses and synthetic environments and things like that; and it's been really interesting in terms of what I've understood, and how, in terms of thinking about people from different parts of the world, and how we find our way to communicate about what we understand about blockchain, but specifically Cardano, how we understand it, what its value is, across communities. So sometimes there's linkages. So both what Petr is saying, and what Eric was saying seems to be true. Even if your project may have a local focus, the way it's communicated could be more global.

**59:33  Daniel**  In our project, the major difficulty is trying to send a message to different languages, but not only languages, also different cultures, because they are very different, because the economic realities in different places are very different, so it is very difficult to, to try to send a message that everybody will get the same way.

**1:01:35  Petr, challenge team** Thank you, Daniel. Now the room is about to close, so thank you, everyone for being here. And let's keep in touch.

**1:02:22  End**
