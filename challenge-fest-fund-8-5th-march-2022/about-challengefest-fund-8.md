# About ChallengeFest Fund 8

ChallengeFest is a regular event run by Catalyst Swarm to enable challenge teams to highlight their Challenge.

Challenge teams run a breakout room where potential proposers can come and talk about a proposal idea, ask questions, meet other proposers and build collaborations, and generally familiarise themselves with the challenge setting.
