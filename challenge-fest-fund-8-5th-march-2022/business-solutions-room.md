## About the challenge

The Fund 8 [Business Solutions challenge](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/campaigns/26445/about) has a total challenge budget of $1M in ADA, and there are 146 ideas posted.

\
The key question of the challenge setting is:

> <mark style="color:red;">**How can Cardano-based solutions help meet real business needs and what would be their impact?**</mark>

**Note:** This event took place on 5th March 2022. Some of the proposals mentioned may not have finally been submitted in this funding round.

## Summary

**0:00 Oscar, challenge team:** introductory presentation.\
The challenge has a budget of $1M, and is about business solutions that can run on the Cardano blockchain; both business-to-business and business-to-customer.

**11:35   Mohamed Mahmoud:**  from Culture Tourism Beyond Borders  [https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/399247](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/399247)\
Cultural tourism (visiting monuments, temples, pyramids etc) is expensive. We will create a metaverse that will restore monuments and allow people to visit them remotely from any location in the world. It will change how the tourism industry works, by providing affordable options for those who can’t afford to travel to cultural sites.

**14:29 Oussama ben Mahmoud :** from PeakChain Fleet Management Platform [https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397257](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397257) ****  Vehicles are highly connected IoT devices requiring added security and data privacy; but there's no blockchain standard for the automobile industry, and currently all vehicles are connected to centralised servers. We've chosen Cardano as a platform for building connected car dApps. We also have another proposal, PeakChain Car Sharing platform. You can support our proposals by providing feedback, sharing our projects and articles on your social media, and delegating to our staking pool, PeakChain Pool: ticker \[PKCP].

**17:02   Oscar, challenge team**: we have around 30 minutes; we can give 15 minutes for each proposal to brainstorm how we can improve it. We can start with Mohamed.

**17:40 Mohamed Mahmoud:**   Our metaverse targets the problem of the cost of cultural tourism; and factors like war and unrest which make travel difficult. We were established in 2012 and we work mainly on enterprise applications such as CRM systems. I have known about blockchain since 2017-18, but I didn't take it seriously back then; but in 2021 we started giving attention to it and how it's impacting the business models that we used to work on; it’s a completely different model.

Our idea has two parts: a foundation; and the restoration process. The foundation is a central, publicly available repository of ideas - whenever someone wants to restore a part of human civilization, they can use this as a reference. The restoration process is a use-case for the metaverse: a metaverse is not only about games.

Our first project will focus on ancient Egyptian civilization. We will select particular monuments and restore them as they were built. And not only buildings – we will try to restore the life of the time, with people walking around, people trading, festivals and ceremonies.&#x20;

We have noticed that in the Egyptian market, very few people are aware of blockchain, so our intention with this projects is to introduce it to North African market, and Egypt especially.

We have started a whitepaper (not complete yet) - we are working with a solution architect to develop the concept of a culture metaverse, as opposed to a gaming metaverse; how our smart contracts will work in our proposed use-case; and the concept of a decentralised game engine.

The proposal is only for the first three months: a broad awareness campaign to initialise our white paper and to raise awareness. We are seeking partnerships for the development team, the game designing and so on.&#x20;

It's a huge project, and we need everyone to help.

**Oscar, challenge team 32:29** In all blockchain solutions, community is the key.

**Oussama 33:41** We are building connected car applications on Cardano.&#x20;

Cars are highly connected to the internet; but via centralised servers. They could be connected to the blockchain, to increase privacy and security. Our mission is establishing Cardano as the blockchain standard for the automobile industry; we’ve chosen Cardano because it’s decentralised, secure, and has good governance.

We want to become the world's leading blockchain solution provider for the automobile industry, based on the Cardano blockchain. We are based in Germany; so our goal is to promote our solutions in the German and international market.

We have a related proposal for a car sharing platform. But in this Challenge, we have this proposal for a fleet management platform.

Many companies have their own fleet of vehicles; management includes monitoring location, driver behaviour, speed etc. Centralised solutions exist; we want to migrate this centralised solution to Cardano. We have built a prototype of the hardware we will use; it is connected directly to the car, without any third-party solution.&#x20;

Data from each trip is processed, then the fleet manager receives email or SMS notification. The front end web application is connected with the Cardano blockchain via the APIs, and it gets the trip data from the blockchain; and the fleet manager accesses the data directly from the blockchain, not from our servers.

The first iteration will work like this; and once Cardano Hydra and scaling solutions are in place, we will migrate to a 100% decentralised solution. So our goal is a hardware wallet embedded directly in the car. Also in the midterm, we aim to house the front end web application in the IPFS so it is decentralised.

To show the feasibility of the project, we have built a prototype and implemented and tested successfully most parts of it.

**45:00**  An example of what the data looks like.

Our team of two are Plutus pioneers, and have experience in project management and software quality.&#x20;

Our budget for 3 months is $39,000.

**Oscar  47:05**  Invites Naveed to give feedback to the proposals

**Naveed  47:30** Two fantastic proposals! Some specific feedback: both of you would benefit from putting in a high-level roadmap. Start your proposal with your vision, which may sound really huge; but then break it down into your deliverables and scope for the 3 months of your proposal.

**Mohamed  49:54** We put in the proposal very fast because of the time constraint, but we are aiming to add detail. What we are targeting for this 3 months is completing the architecture, building the partnership, and the marketing and awareness campaign; and to start building the team for the actual platform development. Most of the money will go for the awareness campaign.

**Oscar  51:11** So the suggestion was that you could show the breakdown of your expenses in detail, because people really check the costs in detail.&#x20;

**Naveed 52:03** I think that's part of the transparency, right? Your roadmap is saying, Here's my vision, one year, two years, it’s not gonna be built in three months; but here's my phase 1, my MVP.

**Mohamed  52:23** To have the roadmap, we have two constraints. The first one is what we call the restoration roadmap – the Egyptologists have to decide which monument they will restore. And the other roadmap is the platform roadmap – this is more dependent on the architecture that we select. But I believe you're right, and we will try to do this before we close the proposal refining process.

**Naveed 52:51** Even if you've got a plan to get to those points; because honestly people will see $96,000 and will immediately go, "that’s enough to feed my whole family for a year – why am I voting for this?"&#x20;

**Mohamed  53:12** I understand. I will try to do my best; I agree. I'm open to challenges, that's fine for me.

**Naveed  53:57** So Oussama with yours, just very quickly: you didn't say in your presentation what you needed the money for. So it sounds like you got everything sorted already!

**Oussama 54:42** The basic infrastructure of the two projects are nearly complete, but there is also a lot of implementations which are a little bit different. So we have planned 50% of our time in one project and 50% on the other project, because there is a lot of coincidence between the projects. I have listed all the six team members, what we are doing, and the budget. We have made a very humble budget calculation; we are only asking for the minimum, in order to gain trust of the community, get feedback from the community ; because we have a bigger project long term.
