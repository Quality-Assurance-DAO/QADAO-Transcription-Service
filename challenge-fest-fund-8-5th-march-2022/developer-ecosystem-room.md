> <mark style="color:red;">**How can we create a positive developer experience that helps the developer focus on building successful apps?**</mark>

**Note:** This event took place on 5th March 2022. Some of the proposals mentioned may not have finally been submitted in this funding round.

## Summary

**0:00 John Woodard, proposer:** from Wolfram Catalyst Impact Dashboard [https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/400305](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/400305) We want to do virtual seminars on our progress

**0:45 John Woodard, proposer:** Placeholders and why we do them!        &#x20;

**3:04 John Santi, proposer:** First-time proposer                 &#x20;

**3:17 Frank Albanese, proposer**: part of SnapBrillia team with _“Mentor-mentee Bounties & eLearning”_ [https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397419](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/397419) &#x20;

**4:49 John Woodard, proposer:** Analytics and visualisations on governance. Collecting the Cardano community’s questions about fund 1 to fund 7.

**7:13 John Woodard, proposer:**  Choosing which challenge to submit in, if your proposal potentially fits in several.

**7:54 Thomas Wedler, challenge team:** Alignment is important – CAs will give a low score to poorly-aligned proposals

**8:45 Thomas Wedler, challenge team:** If you change category too late or you have a lot of placeholders, you miss the chance for feedback and questions from the community. Answering questions is important to show that you’re “real”.

**10:31  John Woodard, proposer:** visualisation of correlation between overall score, and requested funding amount

**12:01 John Woodard, proposer:** We want to make data visualisations available to the community in the time leading up to voting, and create a dashboard to connect analytics and make them easily available

**13:04 John Woodard, proposer:**  KPIs – what should we include?

**13:32 Thomas Wedler, challenge team**: If you are funded, funds are paid in installments, not a lump sum. Funds will be released if you meet your milestones, so KPIs can be crucial

**16:34 Jo8n, proposer:** Project Catalyst should develop a better IdeaScale and sell it to IdeaScale!

**19:32 Jo8n, proposer:** It’s mostly devs that we want to attract to Catalyst, right?

**19:37 Thomas Wedler, challenge team:** No, we want to attract devs to _**Cardano**_. Catalyst is only the fund or accelerator; we are not just focusing on Catalyst itself. The purpose of Catalyst is to make Cardano a better blockchain.

**21:23 John Santi, proposer:** my proposal may be out of scope of the funding for this challenge. Dealing with issues around storing wallet information, passwords, etc.\
**25:46:** design issues on IdeaScale that made it hard to find my way\
**26:40:**  In an AMA last month Charles Hoskinson quoted Moxie Marlinspike saying Web3 is just a glorified Web2 and is still centralised; no-one wants to run a server. I’m developing an approach to deal with that and enable a decentralised server cache so we could slowly phase out some of the centralised points\
**29:05**: the issue of proposers who are not coders, and who might feel they don’t belong or don’t have sufficient knowledge

**30:08 John Woodard, proposer:** Woolfram run several proof-of-stake nodes for other blockchains than Cardano, and have been involved for around 5 years. But issues with community-orientated development: Wolfram Blockchain Labs just work on infrastructure. So if an idea doesn’t fit what we are already developing, then it’s not for us. There is so much going on in the blockchain space – if you don’t figure out your focus, every week you’ll find something absolutely amazing that you want to jump into! We will run seminars to capture community feedback – but figuring out how people will work directly with us, is not yet sure.

**34:20 John Santi, proposer**: We had great support and liaison from June Akra

34:36 **June Akra, challenge team**: importance of challenge teams and Telegram group

**35:28 Unknown speaker:**  Newly involved; interested from tech standpoint and has been attending Swarm sessions. Has set up a stakepool on testnet, but has realised even if it goes live, it will not get any delegators without advertising.

**37:05 Thomas Wedler, challenge team**  Some say you need 1.5 to 2m ADA  to make it worth your while.

**38:19 Sebastian Pabon, proposer:** from DeFi Discussions; proposal to translate Plutus and Haskell course material into Spanish [https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398184](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/398184) . Will be working with selected univeraities in Latin America. Does it fit the challenge?

**40:06 Thomas Wedler, challenge team**: Yes – the challenge brief says that anything that makes a developer’s life easier and attracts people to develop on Cardano is suitable. Last fund there were a lot of challenges specifically for different places, such as Grow Cardano Grow Latin America, but this time there are not; but I think you very much make the developer’s life easier so you’re eligible for this category.

**41:25 Frank Albanese, proposer:**  this is our first time participating and we have met some great people – we come from the Ethereum ecosystem initially. I learned a lot from the founders of GitCoin. Anyone curious about an open-source, quadratic funding/bounty system please reach out to us; we’d love to collaborate. Also interested in recruitment, and methods for validating people’s job experience.

**43:25 Thomas Wedler, challenge team**   - Addresses many important issues; people are talking about how to improve authenticity, prevent fake proposals and fake LinkedIn profiles, etc

**43:57 Frank Albanese proposer:** We at Snapbrillia are a team of about 45 engineers – some are retraining in Haskell just to be able to support Cardano. So if anyone has a project that is looking for Haskell engineers, we are open to collaboration. Also anyone researching proof of identity and/or proof of reputation.

**46:05 John Santi, proposer**: wild idea for animated avatars!

**47:55** End
