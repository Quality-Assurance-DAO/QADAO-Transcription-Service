# About IdeaFest

![](<../.gitbook/assets/swarm logo.JPG>)

IdeaFest is concept begun by [Catalyst Swarm](https://catalystswarm.com), and takes place each funding round. Proposers are invited to make a short presentation about their proposal, and then to take questions.&#x20;

Swarm Fund 8 IdeaFest was so popular that it ran over 2 consecutive Saturdays. You'll find a list of the proposers who presented each day, in each room, at the links below. Then navigate to the page for the breakout room you want, where you'll find detailed timestamps, links to the proposals themselves, etc.\
