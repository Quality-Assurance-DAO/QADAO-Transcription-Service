# Summary videos

This format can be created during a meeting itself, or done soon after. It needs to be done by someone who was present in the meeting.

Basically, it involves a participant recording a short (1 to 2-minute) video where they outline verbally what was discussed.&#x20;

1. The last 5 minutes of a meeting can be devoted to agreeing between the participants what will be said; or alternatively, a trusted participant can decide what to say.
2. It can be effective to focus on decisions and action items.
3. The summariser might also screenshare any documentation, such as a spreadsheet, Miro board, or Google doc, and talk through it.
4. An alternative approach is to record each meeting participant in turn saying what was discussed in the meeting in their opinion. Each speaker only says things that are additional to what has already been said; and if someone has nothing to add, they can pass.
5. For more discursive or creative meetings, each speaker could be asked, for example, to say one comment from someone else that will stay with them; something that changed their mind or made them see things differently; or similar.

Overall this is a low-overhead and simple form of documentation that still manages to give a good overview of what happened. For more complex meetings, however, especially those where important decisions are made, it might not be detailed enough.
