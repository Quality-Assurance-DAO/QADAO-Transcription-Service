# Layered documentation

For text-based summaries, especially ones that will be held on a GitBook or similar, a useful principle is offering nested layers of information that allows people to drill down to the level of detail they want.

Historically, this approach comes from museum and gallery information, where often, there is brief top-level information on the wall, with more detailed information in a catalogue. Of course, it raises the question of what the “top level” information should actually be: deciding this is an important part of the documenter’s skill. It will vary depending on the type of meeting; and, if you are documenting for an outside organisation, may be best decided in consultation with the community in the meeting.

You can see [an example here](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/governance-guild/grassroots-governance-community-forums/forum-2-31st-august-2023) of this type of documentation - note how sub-pages are used to create 2 layers of detail.&#x20;

You could, of course, have more layers, offering background reading on specific topics, more detailed discussion of particular ideas, etc.
