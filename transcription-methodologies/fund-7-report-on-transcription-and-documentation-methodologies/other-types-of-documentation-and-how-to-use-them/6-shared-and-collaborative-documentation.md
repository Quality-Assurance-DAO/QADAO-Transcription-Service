# Shared and collaborative documentation

Documentation doesn't always have to be done by one person. Collaborative approaches can share the workload, raise awareness of the importance of documentation, and support people to develop documantation skills.

1. Summary video, discussed in the previous page, can be done as a form of collaborative documentation, by everyone in a meeting.
2. There are other collaborative approaches, which can be useful to spread the workload, and particularly to mitigate the need for everyone to have a high level of knowledge about the meeting topic and a high level of language skill.
3. Examples of collaborative approaches include a shared doc where anyone who is not speaking can take notes; taking notes in the meeting Chat; and use of tools such as Miro boards.
4. Note that while collaborative approaches can be a good way to introduce the idea of documentation to a community, and to support new documenters, they often benefit from someone taking the role of reviewer/editor and “tidying up” the documentation at the end.
