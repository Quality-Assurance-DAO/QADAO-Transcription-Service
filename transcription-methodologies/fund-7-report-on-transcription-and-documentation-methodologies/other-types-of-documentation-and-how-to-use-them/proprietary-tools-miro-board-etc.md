# Proprietary tools (Miro board etc)

1. Proprietary formats such as Miro are vulnerable to obsolescence in the long term, so are not useful for archival-level documentation. Also, as they are not text-based, they are not searchable or indexable, making the information in them not very discoverable.&#x20;
2. In Catalyst many people say they find it difficult to follow the Miro board of a meeting they were not at.
3. Also, some participants struggle with accessing Miro if they have a poor Internet connection and/or are joining a meeting on their phone. This can limit their participation.
4. For these reasons, Miro and similar formats should usually be supplemental, not primary or standalone, forms of documentation.
5. However, as described in “summary video” above, a short video which talks through a Miro board can work as standalone documentation of a meeting.
