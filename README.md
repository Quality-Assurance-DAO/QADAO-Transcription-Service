![](<.gitbook/assets/transcribe (1).jpg>)

[QA-DAO Transcription Service](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/383492) is a Catalyst Fund 7 proposal that aims to document, summarise and transcribe key Catalyst community events and meetings, to help make them more accessible and discoverable.

In this GitBook you can find all the events we have documented as part of the proposal, as well as some related material documented by others, e.g.  CATH (Catalyst Africa Town Hall) IdeaFest and ETH (Eastern TownHall) Ideafest Reels.
