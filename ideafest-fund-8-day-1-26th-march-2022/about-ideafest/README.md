# About IdeaFest

IdeaFest is a regular event run by [Catalyst Swarm](https://catalystswarm.com), which takes place each funding round. Proposers are invited to make a short presentation about their proposal, and then to take questions.&#x20;

Fund 8's IdeaFest was so popular that it ran over 2 days: 26th March and 2nd April 2022.
